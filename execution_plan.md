# MealTracker AI - Execution Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup (1-2 days)
- Initialize React application using Create React App
- Set up project structure and directories
- Install necessary dependencies:
  - React Router for navigation
  - A UI component library (e.g., Material-UI or Tailwind CSS)
  - React Dropzone or similar for image uploads
- Create basic application layout (header, content area, navigation)
- Set up localStorage utility functions for data persistence

## Phase 2: Photo Upload Component (2-3 days)
- Create `PhotoUpload` component with:
  - Drag and drop area for photos
  - Camera access on supported devices
  - Image preview functionality
  - Basic image validation (size, format)
- Add temporary storage of uploaded images
- Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Phase 3: AI Food Recognition Integration (3-4 days)
- Research and select appropriate AI food recognition service:
  - Option A: Pre-trained TensorFlow.js model
  - Option B: Simple external API (like Clarifai or Google Cloud Vision)
- Create `FoodRecognition` component to:
  - Process uploaded images
  - Make API calls to the selected service
  - Parse and display recognition results
  - Allow manual corrections of AI predictions
- Add basic error handling for API failures

## Phase 4: Meal Logging System (2-3 days)
- Design data structure for meal entries
- Create `MealLog` component with:
  - Form for meal details (date, time, meal type)
  - Display of recognized food items
  - Option to manually add/remove/edit foods
  - Save functionality to localStorage
- Implement basic validation
- Add confirmation messages

## Phase 5: Dashboard and History View (2-3 days)
- Create `Dashboard` component to:
  - Display recent meals with photos and identified foods
  - Implement simple filtering by date
  - Create a calendar or timeline view of meals
- Add meal editing and deletion functionality
- Implement basic pagination or infinite scroll for history

## Phase 6: Testing and Refinement (2-3 days)
- Perform cross-browser testing
- Optimize for mobile devices
- Improve error handling
- Address edge cases:
  - No AI recognition results
  - Failed image uploads
  - localStorage limitations
- Basic performance optimization

## Phase 7: Documentation and Deployment (1-2 days)
- Update README with final instructions
- Add inline code documentation
- Deploy to GitHub Pages or similar free hosting
- Create simple user guide

## Total Estimated Time: 13-20 days

### Key Milestones
1. **Day 2**: Working application shell with navigation
2. **Day 5**: Functional photo upload component
3. **Day 9**: Working AI food recognition
4. **Day 12**: Complete meal logging functionality
5. **Day 15**: Functional dashboard with history view
6. **Day 18**: Refined application with testing complete
7. **Day 20**: Deployed proof of concept

### Testing Strategy
- Manual testing of each component as it's developed
- Focus on core user flows:
  - Upload photo → Get AI analysis → Save meal → View in dashboard
- Test on multiple devices and browsers
- Test with various food images to verify AI recognition
